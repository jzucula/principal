Account Owners and Project Managers

In this guide, you will learn how to get started in Smartling and translate a file. We will create an account, add a linguistic package (which includes a glossary, a style guide, translation leverage, and quality checks), set up a workflowâ€”and then translate and download your files.


Step 1: Activate your Account

When your Smartling Account Manager or Customer Success Manager creates your Smartling account, you will receive an email invitation to activate your account (see below).

As this is from a "noreply" email address, ensure to check Spam and make noreply@smartling.com a safe sender to your mailbox.
